Convert pubspec into formatted markdown

## Getting Started

To test, run `scratch.dart` or `generator readme.py` for python variant

## GitHub action

This is the first project where I started to use [Flutter action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flutter-action). Credit to this [article](https://medium.com/mobile-development-group/github-actions-for-flutter-cf02923d7b5d) for clear explanations.
